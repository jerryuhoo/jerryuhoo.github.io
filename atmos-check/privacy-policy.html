        <h1>Privacy Policy for Atmos Check</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 12, 2025</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Atmos Check. We understand that your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains our
            principles regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information. Our core principle is simple:
            <strong>Atmos Check does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or content.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            The Mac App Store version of Atmos Check is designed to be a completely self-contained, offline tool. We
            want to be crystal clear about what this means for you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect or request any personally identifiable
                information, such as your name, email address, or location.</li>
            <li><strong>No User Content:</strong> The application processes your audio files (e.g., `.wav` files)
                exclusively on your local device. These files and their contents are <strong>never</strong> uploaded,
                transmitted, or
                accessed by us.</li>
            <li><strong>No Usage Analytics:</strong> The application does not contain any analytics or tracking
                services. We do not monitor how you use the app.</li>
            <li><strong>No Network Communication:</strong> The application does not initiate any network connections to
                our servers or any third-party services. All functionality is performed offline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Files Are Handled</h2>
        <p>
            When you use Atmos Check to analyze your audio files, all processing occurs locally on your computer. The
            app requires you to grant access to your files via the standard macOS file-picker dialog or by dragging and
            dropping them into the app. This permission is granted on a case-by-case basis by you and is managed by
            macOS. We do not have persistent access to your file system.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the app's functionality changes. We will notify you of
            any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
        </p>

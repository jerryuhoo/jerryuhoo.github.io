In singing voice synthesis (SVS), generating singing voices from musical scores faces challenges due to limited data availability, a constraint less common in text-to-speech (TTS). This study proposes a new approach to address this data scarcity. We utilize an existing singing voice synthesizer for data augmentation and apply precise manual tuning to reduce unnatural voice synthesis. Our development of two extensive singing voice corpora, ACE-Opencpop and KiSing-v2, facilitates large-scale, multi-singer voice synthesis. Utilizing pre-trained models derived from these corpora, we achieve notable improvements in voice quality, evident in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. The corpora, pre-trained models, and their related training recipes are publicly available at Muskits-ESPnet.

**Single**

Lyrics:

I become immortal  
Wandering from the earth on the morrow  
Dried tears without any sorrow  
If there is light I’ll just follow  

All is meaningless  
If consciousness can live without substance  
I’ll never know who I am  
Never know where’s the end  
 
I am dust in the universe  
Can’t escape from the curse  
Homeless, drown in loneliness  

I am dust in the universe  
Can’t escape from the curse  
Heartless, in the darkness  
 
I am lonely  
Floating in the universe  
Painful, Angry  
Such Darkness and silence  

I am crazy  
Nobody can save me  
Madness, Sadness  
Only this vast space understands me

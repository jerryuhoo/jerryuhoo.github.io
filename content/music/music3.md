Lyrics:

**The end of the world**

The sky is crashing down  
falling into the boundless ground  
too hard to sing a song  
tears in my eyes rolling down  
 

The fire is burning bright  
Stirring up the silent night  
There’s nowhere I can find you  
But your voice echoes in my mind  
 

I walk among the hopeless  
searching for your face  
shadows rise from the surface  
swallowing everything in its path  
I scream your name  
longing to hear your voice  
longing to feel your embrace  
but all I hear are cries of pain  
the flames surround me  
burning like the memory of you  
a memory that will remain  
but hope has been lost  
the end is here  

**Break free**


In the night  
In the dark  
The world is about to end  
No way to run  
Nowhere to hide  
We fall into abyss  

All our hopes  
All our dreams  
Are burning in despair  
No more flame  
No more faith  
Everything is grey  

How much pain are we going to take?  
When I wake up in this rainy day  
How much more are we going to take?  
To make my way  

There’s a monster screaming inside of me  
Crushing the shadows with his teeth  
I was shackled in the deep  
Before I break free  

There’s a monster screaming inside of me  
Crushing the shadows with his teeth  
I was shackled in the deep  
Before I break free  

Hold my sword  
Bide my time  
Before the blood was dry  
Maybe now  
We can fight  
I am not afraid to die  

Holding tight  
For my life  
Make the future bright  
Just one more day  
And one more night  
It’s time to see the light  

How much pain are we going to take?  
When I wake up in this rainy day  
How much more are we going to take?  
To make my way  

There’s a monster screaming inside of me  
Crushing the shadows with his teeth  
I was shackled in the deep  
Before I break free  

There’s a monster screaming inside of me  
Crushing the shadows with his teeth  
I was shackled in the deep  
Before I break free

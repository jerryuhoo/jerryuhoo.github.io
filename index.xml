In singing voice synthesis (SVS), generating singing voices from musical scores faces challenges due to limited data availability, a constraint less common in text-to-speech (TTS). This study proposes a new approach to address this data scarcity. We utilize an existing singing voice synthesizer for data augmentation and apply precise manual tuning to reduce unnatural voice synthesis.</description></item><item><title>A Systematic Exploration of Joint-training for Singing Voice Synthesis</title><link>https://jerryuhoo.github.io/articles/2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jerryuhoo.github.io/articles/2/</guid><description>Yuning Wu, Yifeng Yu, Jiatong Shi, Tao Qian, Qin Jin
There has been a growing interest in using end-to-end acoustic models for singing voice synthesis (SVS). Typically, these models require an additional vocoder to transform the generated acoustic features into the final waveform. However, since the acoustic model and the vocoder are not jointly optimized, a gap can exist between the two models, leading to suboptimal performance. Although a similar problem has been addressed in the TTS systems by joint-training or by replacing acoustic features with a latent representation, adopting corresponding approaches to SVS is not an easy task.</description></item><item><title>Fire</title><link>https://jerryuhoo.github.io/portfolio/design1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jerryuhoo.github.io/portfolio/design1/</guid><description>Hi, I made a free multi-band distortion plugin „ÄéFire„Äè.

Lyrics:
I become immortal
Wandering from the earth on the morrow
Dried tears without any sorrow
If there is light I‚Äôll just follow
All is meaningless
If consciousness can live without substance
I‚Äôll never know who I am
Never know where‚Äôs the end
I am dust in the universe
Can‚Äôt escape from the curse
Homeless, drown in loneliness
I am dust in the universe
Can‚Äôt escape from the curse</description></item><item><title>The End Of The World</title><link>https://jerryuhoo.github.io/music/music3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jerryuhoo.github.io/music/music3/</guid><description>EP
Catastrophe The end of the world This is war Break free Memory flow Lyrics:
The end of the world
The sky is crashing down
falling into the boundless ground
too hard to sing a song
tears in my eyes rolling down
The fire is burning bright
Stirring up the silent night
There‚Äôs nowhere I can find you
But your voice echoes in my mind
I walk among the hopeless</description></item></channel></rss>
